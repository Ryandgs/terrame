--[[ [previous](data.lua) | [contents](../00-contents.lua) | [next](../00-contents.lua)

File description.lua presents a general description of the data that is going to
be documented. You can use it to document the authors, licence of the data, and
other information (see all the available names [here](https://github.com/TerraME/terrame/wiki/Packages#Description)). To run this, as this package
has a data script, it is necessary to click in the menu "Project" above,
activating the following actions:

1) "Create Projects": This option run all the data scripts within the package.
   Every time the data script changes it is necessary to execute this again.
2) "Documentation Sketch:" If the script "data.lua" does not exist, or if you have
   added new data to be documented, you can create/update "data.lua" by running
   this option. In this case, running this command will not change data.lua.
3) "Build Documentation": Create the documentation for the data. In this case,
   it will be created in directory itaituba/doc.
4) "View Documentation": show the created documentation.
