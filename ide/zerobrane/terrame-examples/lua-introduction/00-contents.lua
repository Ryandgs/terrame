# Lua for TerraME

This tutorial presents the main concepts of Lua language necessary to use TerraME.
It is a rather simplified collection of some freely available material on Lua
language. It is based mainly on the book "Programming in Lua" and on Lua's webpage
(lua.org), being adapted for those with or without some programming background and
need to learn Lua in order to start developing models in TerraME. Because this
tutorial has almost no originality in its content, instead of citing it, please use
its original sources.

Lua (pronounced LOO-AH) means "Moon" in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an
acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the
name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language. Like most names, it should
be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua". Please do not
write it as "LUA", which is both ugly and confusing, because then it becomes an
acronym with different meanings for different people. So, please, write "Lua"
right! (Source: http://www.lua.org/about.html)
