# Multiple Simulations

This page presents the models implemented in the tutorial
_Multiple Simulations_, available [here](https://github.com/TerraME/terrame/wiki/Calibration).

This tutorial requires several packages. If some script stops with an error saying
that a package could not be found, go to menu "Project" and then "Package Manager"
then "Install Package" then select the package and then click "Install".

After implementing a Model and verifying that it works properly, it is usually
necessary to execute experiments through several simulations. This process allows
the modeler to investigate if the model always converge to a stable state, the
possible effects of specific parameters of the model, as well as calibrating the
model to better fit real data. Package calibration provides functionalities to
facilitate achieving such objectives.
